As a reader which camp do you belong to when it comes to books that you don't enjoy reading?
1. Sunken cost fallacy
2. Close it so as to not stall the reading in general(read many at once) up Yuval if you dont get something ahha in the first 10 pages, dont wait for it till page 300. Marc and Naval don't bother toss it away. Cons to Dixon's blog approach
Break down the pros and cons of both. Also include all the stories of important people that belong to camp 2. 
Gates --> doesnt let himself pick a book he wont finish
Morgan
Catch 22 situation, ultimate meta skill
