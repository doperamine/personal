> #### Atoms and Bits are mingling a lot more now, having existed almost entirely in completely different worlds until a few years ago. 
 A `bit` ( or a binary information digit ) is a big deal and make no mistake about it, it really is.
 Though the bit was born only 72 years ago <cite>[^1]</cite> the bit is giving the atom (came about 13.7 billion years ago) and the cell (born some 3.8 billion years ago) a run for their money. 
 
 Looking back at the last 20 years of innovation<cite>[^2]</cite> or technological progress, hasn't it been mostly, if not entirely about the digital world or the world of bits. Software 1.0 has literally ate the world <cite>[^3]</cite> and is religously being upgraded to Software 2.0 <cite>[^4]</cite>. Fusion of technologies, characterized by the fourth industrial revolution <cite>[^5]</cite> is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. 
 __This blog is my humble attempt to go interdisciplinary, learn beyond the world of computers and software and go about connecting the world of atoms, bits and if possible even the world of cells.__

Isn't it a no-brainer that we have to innovate on all the 3 levels to make it to the next level of civilization <cite>[^6]</cite>.
> ##### Though we don't think much about atoms or bits or cells,  they epitomize creation and that makes them interesting.
